Initial stuff for Nick's drawbot project.

Inkscape should be set to not use relative coordinates (Uncheck Preferences > SVG output > Allow relative coordinates).

Currently using 1000 as the width of the SVG, assuming pulleys at top corners. (set in Document Properties, 1000px width)

Inkscape process:
* Draw with pen
* Path edit mode (F2)
* Select all nodes
* Subdivide (+ button) until happy
* Convert segments to lines

There's an extension (Extensions > Modify Path > Add Nodes...) which could be used for smarter subdivision. Needs lxml library.

SVG coordinate scheme runs from top left corner:
0,0 ------------------ 1000,0
|                           |
|                           |
|                           |
|                           |
|                           |
|                           |
|                           |
0,1000 ------------ 1000,1000

svg_path_extract.pl:
Run on SVG, prints sequence of points x1,y1 x2,y2 ...
New line for each path.

convert_to_radial.pl:
Takes output from svg_path_extract, converts to the radial coordinate frame.  Also truncates to integers.
Constants: width of svg, scaling factor.

Usage: ./svg_path_extract.pl example1.svg |./convert_to_radial.pl
(these tools could probably be merged)
