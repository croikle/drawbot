2950 steps is about 1 foot 8 inches = 508 mm
	B was 1 foot 7, A was 1 foot 9
	then in another run B was 1 foot 8

1 step = 508/2950 mm = 0.172 mm = 6.78 milli-inches
1000 steps = 172 mm = 6.78 inches
1 mm = 2950/508 steps = 5.8 steps
1 m = 5800 steps
1 in = 147 steps
1 ft = 1768 steps

distance between corners is 2 foot 11 in = 35 in = 5145 steps
